# Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition

Solutions in Python.

## How to use
There are two parts in the solutions, one is the thoughts/processes when solving those problems, the other is the code.
Since I think the thoughts/processes are more important than the code, all the code are put under chapters/code.
The other thing is that I personally like using IPython Notebook. If you are not familiar with it, that's fine, you could find all files in html format under chapters/html.

Happy coding!
