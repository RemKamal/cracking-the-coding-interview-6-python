    "Imagine a stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure set_of_stacks that mimics this. set_of_stacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. set_of_stacks.push() and set_of_stacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack)."
